Clone the repo and Create pull-request

While collaborating your work, showcase how conflicts are resolved

Create tag such as open issue, or feature-added

Do a force push and then later reset the changes

Stage “development branch to production branch”

Showcase how features are released in versions (merging production to master branch)
